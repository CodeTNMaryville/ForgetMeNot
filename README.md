# ForgetMeNot

CodeTN Maryville Team

Website: Forget Me Not

Concept: An aid for people with memory loss. Retirement homes create accounts and add a profile for each resident that they want to take part. Then, families and the retirement home can upload pictures and music to a specific residents profile. When residents are agitated and upset, staff with sit with them and use what is provided in their profile in order to help calm them.

When adding files to the repository, please make sure to name it specifically what is for, along with v0.1, v0.2, etc. at the end. Also when uploading another version of the website, be sure to include all the files needed in the folder (HTML, CSS, php, etc), not just an HTML.
